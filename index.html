        <p>I am really interested in Pokemon.  
           I have been been pokemon ever since I was a kid.  
           It started with my collecting pokemon cards.  
           I had a large binder with over 1000 different pokemon cards.  
           Along with my collection I also have played a variety of different pokemon games.
           I started playing on the nintendo 3ds with the Pokemon Y.  I then moved onto the next series of games
           which was Pokemon Omega Ruby, then Pokemon Sun and finally Pokemon Shield.  I have had a lot of fun playing these games
           and I have built up a substantial digital collection of various legendary, pseudo-lengedary and shiny pokemon from almost 
           every different pokemon region in the game.  These digital collections spans even greater than my physical pokemon card collection.
           Currently though I have decided to step away from the traditional pokemone game that have been getting released each year to focus on
           a relatively new game that has come out know as Pokemon TCG.  This game is based off the actually physical pokemon game you can play if you 
           collect the cards useself.  The battle mechanics are the same as the traditional card game and it is somewhat similiar to the digital game played
           on nintendos systmes with some minor changes like the bundling together of types such as fighting and ground types.  Items and potions are still
           common to both games although the addition of some new support cards seperate the pokect game from the traditional one.</p>
