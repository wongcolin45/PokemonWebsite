        <p>Pokemon has a vary complicated battle systems.  It is based around a variety of pokemon attributes such as
            there HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.  HP represent the base health of the pokemon
            and how much damage it can take before it faints and must retreat from battle.  In pokemon there are 2 types of attacks physical
            attacks which be moved such as close combat as commonly done by a pokemon known as Lucario and special attacks which are moves such
            as hyper beam commly used my Gyarados.  A pokemon's attack and defense stacks refer to how strong the pokemeon is at doing and recieving
            physical attack based moved.  The pokemon's special attack and special defense refers how strong a pokmeon a do and recieve special attack based
            moves.  Finally the last stats would be a pokemon's speed which refers to how fast they can move.  This would determin which pokemon is able to attack
            first in a game.  For example Pickachu has a greater speed stat than the pokemon Snorlax so it would attack first in a game.  On type of these each
            pokemon is given acess to a variety of different moves all have there own unique type.  Type can alter the effectivness of certain moves with sometimes
            causes a boast in 2x the damage or possibly 1/2 of the damage do to type resistance.  Each type has it own weakness and strengths too, and these al
            determine whether or not a move will get a 2x multiplier for super effective or 1/2 multiplier if the opposing pokemon is resistant to that type.
            Not all types have easier a super or least effective relationship to each other and sometypes are simply neutral to each other whcih woudld
            get result in a 1x multiplier.
